        <h2>Additives Colors</h2>
        <p>Additive synthesis is a model that explains how a color is obtained from the sum of the color components. The additive rendering process normally uses red, green, and blue light as components to produce the rest of the colors. Combining one of these primary colors with another in equal proportions, the secondary additive colors are obtained: cyan, magenta and yellow. Combining the three primary colors of light with the same intensities, white is produced. Varying the intensity of each colored light finally reveals the full spectrum of these three lights.
          </br>Televisions and computer monitors are the most common practical applications of additive mixing or synthesis.</p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>This form of color synthesis is used in all media that reproduce and/or capture images that depend on the direct emission of light. Among the main uses we have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Process of capturing images from a color photography camera.</li>
          <li>Process of capturing images from a video camera.</li>
          <li>TV screen in its various systems.</li>
          <li>Computer monitor</li>
          <li>Mobile phone screens and other electronic devices</li>
          <li>Slide projector</li>
          <li>Film and video projector in general.</li>

        <h2>Subtractive Colors</h2>
        <p>Subtractive synthesis is a model that explains the mixing of natural paints, dyes, inks, and colorants to create colors that absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others. According to this model, the color of an object depends on the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are reflected by it, or in other words, on the parts of the spectrum that it does not absorb.</p>br>Three things are needed to see a color: a light source, a sample, and a detector (which can be our eyesight).</p>

        <h2>Achromatic Colors</h2>
        <p>Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be unsaturated, achromatic, or neutral. Pure achromatic colors include black, white, and all grays; neutrals include browns, tans, pastels, and darker colors. Close to neutrals they can be of any shade and lightness.</p>

        <p>Neutrals are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or gray, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are colors that are easily modified by more saturated colors and appear to take on the complementary hue of the saturated color. Next to a bright red sofa, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish.</p>

        <P>Black and white colors go well with almost any other color; black decreases the apparent 'saturation or brightness of combined colors, and white shows off all hues with the same effects</P>

        <h2>Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The chromatic circle or color wheel is an ordered and circular representation of colors according to their hue or tone, where primary colors and their derivatives are represented. Its use is compatible both with the Subtractive Color Synthesis models (artistic, pictorial) and with the Additive Color Synthesis models (luminous).</p>
        <h3>Gradient natural color wheel.</h3>
        <p>The chromatic circles can be represented staggered or in gradient (as in the image). Staggers can have any number of colors depending on the author, usually 12, 24, 48 or even more. The so-called hexagram, for example, is a star that is placed in the center of the color wheel, where the number of peaks corresponds to each color and opposite or complementary colors can be shown. In short, it is the representation of colors in a circle or other geometric figure.</p>
